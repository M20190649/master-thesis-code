# Meeting 10.06.2020

* Rerouting statisch vs. dynamisch
  * Rerouting on zone update -> Imitiert die App wo anhand von neuen Zonen eine neue Route gefunden werden kann

* Is distance really the relevant metric?
* Why not charge by time spent in each zone?
  * Cars standing in traffic also contribute to pollution while they are not moving
  * Could also be compared in the simulations -> Very easy to calculate

* Can I used the word "revenue" for the money collected with the toll system?
