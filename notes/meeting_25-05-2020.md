# Meeting 25.05.2020

## Achievements

### Air Data

* Added downloading data for previous day to calculate the 00:00:00 zones
* Added caching (increase speed, better deal with server downtime)
* Added UBA data for 60 minute zone update interval

* Cross Validation

### Simulation

* Remove precalculation of initial routes because they are calculated using the empty network which most likely makes them outdated anyways
* Now SUMO calculated a route shortly before insertion based on current network conditions
* Added periodic automatic rerouting -> Ensure vehicles are always on their optimal route

* Last week I was shocked to find out simulation crashes an random timestep with no good error message or stacktrace for my implementation
  * Contacted SUMO via forum. Luckily they responded quite quickly
  * Sent them debug scenario because I had absolutely no idea
  * No response yet so I did some more digging on the weekend and most likely found the root of the problem: Removing periodic rerouting for vehicles that have been rerouted via TraCI to avoid the critical zones
  * Sent another email to the forum but still no response yet
  * Currently the only solution to run the simulation without error is to disable periodic rerouting
    * Less realistic but more acceptable since now routes are calculated shortly before insertion

* **MATSim and OSM simulation fully functional**

* Simulation writes a "vehicle tracking" XML output file which is used for evaluation
  * Used XML because SUMO already outputs a lot of XML files
  * Added emission class information
  * Added edge information -> Look up the edge type in the network to enable road-type specific pricing

```xml
<timestep time="3851" zone-timestep="01-00-00">
    <vehicle id="164820701_3" zone-timestep="01-00-00" speed="12.924008657813594" edge="138000505#1" emission-class="HBEFA3/PC_D_EU2">
        <polygon id="01-01_00-00-00" zone-timestep="00-00-00"/>
    </vehicle>
    <vehicle id="164820701_4" zone-timestep="01-00-00" speed="13.174199504458054" edge="4475632#4" emission-class="HBEFA3/PC_G_EU4">
        <polygon id="01-01_00-00-00" zone-timestep="00-00-00"/>
        <polygon id="02-00_00-00-00" zone-timestep="00-00-00"/>
        <polygon id="hole-01-01-01_00-00-00" zone-timestep="00-00-00"/>
    </vehicle>
</timestep>
```

* Make sure simulation easily runs on Linux
  * Test it on AWS and provide Amazon Machine Image

* Clean up directory
* Added more logging

* Current configuration file

  "mode": "osm",
  "scenario": "1pct",

```

### Edge Cases

* Vehicle starts trip inside zone
* Vehicle ends trip inside zone
* Does non-departure affect only the ones whose route potentially crosses any zone or the complete population in general?

### Evaluation

* Added a lot of Jupyter Notebooks that parse all the SUMO XML files and calculate a variety of metrics
  * Usually only the base path of the desired scenario needs to be adapted in the beginning

### Performance

* Tested 10pct scenario and it takes more than 24h
* Ideas for speed up
  * Remove one output file (floating-car-data = all vehicle data for every vehicle in every timestep) which gets up to 40 GB
    * It is used for traffic count and traffic heatmap but I could also count this "on-the-fly" because I loop through all vehicle during every step anyways
  * Use a different TraCI interface
    * Regular TraCI connects via sockets to SUMO which acts as a server
    * Libsumo is the same TraCI interface but it is more efficient because it avoids socket communication
    * Might be more complex in the setup process (requires manually building SUMO)

## Current Tasks

* Let simulations run while working on the text
* Work through all annotations and improve the text

### Scenarios

* Which scenarios do I simulate?
  * Just all kinds of combinations and explore?
  * Only choose a few?
  * Justification for choosing certain parameters?
    * Rerouting percentage
    * Non-departure percentage
  * Problem: Very time consuming but I can let different scenarios run simultaneously on multiple AWS instances

### Pricing for Thesis

* Designing the pricing could be a complete thesis on its own

* Question: How do you adequately pay for the damage that emissions cause?
* Do I try to set prices so they somehow match the magnitude of other toll system?
  * Take the average distances in each zone per person, multiply by simple zone price
  * Sum of that should match the magnitude of other toll systems (6-15â‚¬)
  * Is there an upper bound?

* Constant + Distance-based (constant + distance * price)
* Only distance based (distance * price)

* Price reduction for residents
* Price reduction for commercial

* **What should I focus on and where do I draw the line for my thesis?**

* Prices per KM
